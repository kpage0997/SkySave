## Description
 
SkySave is a web app designed to help users find affordable flights quickly and easily. The app will provide a user-friendly interface where users can search for flights based on certain criteria like the date, location, and budget. Once a suitable flight is found, the user will be redirected to a provider site that will handle price comparison and detailed flight information. The motivation for creating SkySave is to simplify the flight search process for travelers, providing a streamlined and efficient way to find flights that fit their needs and budget.
